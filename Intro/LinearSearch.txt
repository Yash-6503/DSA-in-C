Linear Search Algorithm
-This Algorithm is also known as sequential search Algorithm
-Here are basically 2 cases they are as follows
    * Element is Present        ->      print its location
    * Element is not Present

*Working of Linera Search Algorithm
-Here the searching will start from the starting of arrray index a[0].
-Also we will be accessing each element of the index so that the require element should match
-Here there will be 2 stopping conditions they are: 
    * After getting the required element
    * Not getting the element after searching in all indexes
